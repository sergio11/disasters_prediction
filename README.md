# Advanced Classification of Disaster-Related Tweets Using Deep Learning 

In this project, we will build a deep learning model using Keras to classify tweets as real or fake in the context of disasters. 🎯 This task is inspired by the "NLP with Disaster Tweets" challenge and enriched with additional data to improve model performance and insights. 📈 The dataset provides a fascinating opportunity to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on real-world data. 🌎

The dataset contains over 11,000 tweets associated with disaster-related keywords such as "crash," "quarantine," and "bush fires." 🔥 The data structure is based on the original "Disasters on social media" dataset. It includes:

* **Tweets:** The text of the tweet. 💬
* **Keywords:** Specific disaster-related keywords. 🚨
* **Location:** The geographical information provided in the tweets. 📍

These tweets were collected on January 14th, 2020, and cover major events including:

* The eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas, Philippines. 🌋
* The emerging outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19). 🦠
* The devastating Bushfires in Australia. 🔥
* The Iranian downing of flight PS752. ✈️

The dataset contains text that may include profane, vulgar, or offensive language. ⚠️ Please approach with caution during analysis.

## Project Goals

### Inspiration**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying whether a tweet is genuinely related to a disaster or not. This involves:

* Enriching the already available data with newly collected, manually classified tweets. ✍️
* Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning methods to extract meaningful insights. 🧠
* Applying NLP techniques to preprocess, clean, and tokenize the tweets for model training. 🛠️

This notebook will walk through the process of preparing the dataset, building a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance. By the end, we aim to achieve a robust model that can classify disaster tweets with high accuracy. 💯

### Why It Matters

Effective classification of disaster-related tweets has numerous practical applications:

* **Emergency Response:** Helps organizations identify critical information in real time. 🚨
* **Resource Allocation:** Facilitates better planning by focusing on real disasters. 🗺️
* **Misinformation Control:** Mitigates the spread of false information during crises. 🚫
