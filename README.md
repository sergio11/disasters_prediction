# 🌍 Advanced Classification of Disaster-Related Tweets Using Deep Learning 🚨

## **🚀 Overview**

In this project, we're tackling an exciting challenge: **classifying tweets** to determine whether they’re related to disasters or not. Using cutting-edge **deep learning** techniques, this model sifts through tweet data and helps us understand how **social media** reacts to crises in real-time. Inspired by the **"NLP with Disaster Tweets"** challenge, this project is enhanced with additional data to give us deeper insights into disaster-related topics.

🙏 I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to [Santiago Hernández, an expert in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/user/shramos/). His incredible course on Deep Learning, available at Udemy, was instrumental in shaping the development of this project. The insights and techniques learned from his course were crucial in crafting the neural network architecture used in this classifier.

## **📊 Dataset Overview**

### **🗺️ The Dataset**

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vstepanenko/disaster-tweets) includes over **11,000 tweets** focused on major disasters, like the **COVID-19 outbreak**, **Taal Volcano eruption**, and the **bushfires in Australia**. It’s a snapshot of how people react and communicate during global crises.

The data includes:
- **Tweets**: The text content of the tweet 📱
- **Keywords**: Disaster-related keywords like “earthquake” or “flood” 🌪️
- **Location**: Geographical information when available 🌍

Collected on **January 14th, 2020**, it represents critical moments in recent history, including:
- The **Taal Volcano eruption** (Philippines 🌋)
- **COVID-19** (global pandemic 🦠)
- **Bushfires in Australia** (Australia 🔥)
- The **Iranian downing of flight PS752** (international tragedy ✈️)

### **⚠️ Caution**

This dataset contains tweets that may include **offensive language** 😬. Please proceed with caution during analysis.

## **🎯 Project Goals**

### **💡 Why We’re Doing This**

The goal of this project is clear: build a **deep learning model** that can classify tweets as related to disasters or not. Here's how we're approaching it:

1. **Enriching the dataset**: By adding manually classified tweets, we can boost the quality and size of our dataset 📈.
2. **Building a robust model**: Using **deep learning** and **NLP** techniques to extract meaningful features from the data 🔍.
3. **Classifying tweets**: The model will distinguish between disaster-related and non-disaster tweets, helping us understand patterns in social media behavior during crises.

### **💪 Why This Matters**

Why is it important to classify disaster-related tweets? Here are a few reasons:
- **Emergency Response**: Helps first responders prioritize real-time, crucial information 🆘.
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Directs attention to actual disasters and helps prevent the spread of misinformation 🤖.
- **Misinformation Control**: Filters out false information during global crises and ensures people are getting accurate updates 📉.

## **🔧 Methodology**

### **1. Data Preprocessing** 🧹

Before we can train our deep learning model, we need to clean up the data. This includes:
- **Removing URLs**: Twitter links won’t help us classify the content, so we remove them 🔗❌.
- **Eliminating Emojis**: While fun, emojis don't add value in this classification task 😜❌.
- **Removing HTML Tags & Punctuation**: Ensuring we’re working with clean text 🌐✂️.
- **Tokenizing the Text**: Breaking down the tweets into individual words or tokens 🧠.

### **2. Model Architecture** 🏗️

We’re using a **neural network** for classification, which includes:
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers that help the model learn complex patterns from the text.
- **Dropout Layers**: These are used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping connections between layers during training 🔒.
- **Output Layer**: A **sigmoid activation** function to classify each tweet as disaster-related (1) or not (0) 🔄.

### **3. Training the Model** ⏳

We train our model using the **Adam optimizer** and **binary crossentropy loss** function. The model will be trained over several **epochs**, and we evaluate its performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.

### **4. Evaluation & Insights** 📊

After training, we evaluate the model’s performance through:
- **Accuracy**: How often is the model correct?
- **Precision & Recall**: These metrics help us understand how well the model detects true disaster tweets and avoids false positives/negatives.
- **AUC**: The **Area Under the Curve** helps us assess how well the model can differentiate between disaster and non-disaster tweets.

## **📉 Results**

### **Training Progress**

We track the model’s progress using **training and validation loss**, as well as **accuracy**. This helps us understand how well the model is learning and improving during the training process.

## **🔮 Conclusion**

We successfully built a **deep learning model** capable of classifying tweets as disaster-related or not. The model performs well in distinguishing between **genuine disaster tweets** and **irrelevant content**, which is crucial for **emergency response** and **misinformation control** during crises.

## **🌟 Future Work**

We’re not stopping here! There’s still a lot of potential to enhance this project:
- **More Data**: The dataset can be further expanded with more labeled tweets from different events and locations 🌎.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with other techniques like **Word2Vec** or **BERT** for even better text representations 📚.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Imagine deploying this model for **real-time disaster monitoring** on Twitter 🐦.
